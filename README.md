Chat server
===========

Boilerplate app for setting up a websocket-based chat server with JavaScript. Currently set up with a very simple Express app and Webpack bundle.


Getting started
---------------

To install the packages:
```
npm install
```
To bundle the code and start the server:
```
npm start
```
To start the server in watch mode, which will rebundle and restart on any changes to any of the JavaScript files:
```
npm run watch
```
